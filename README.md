Project_Diabetes aims to create a machine-learning model to predict diabetes risk based on healthcare data, focusing on understanding how lifestyle factors contribute to the likelihood of developing diabetes. The project will involve several key steps:

Data Acquisition & Preprocessing: Collect and clean healthcare data, ensuring it is structured for analysis. Handle missing values and outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze and visualize key features like age, diet, exercise habits, and medical history to identify patterns linked to diabetes risk.

Feature Engineering & Selection: Create new features, such as BMI, and select the most relevant variables using statistical methods or machine learning techniques.

Model Development: Experiment with machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM. Train models, tune hyperparameters, and use cross-validation.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate performance using metrics such as Accuracy, AUC-ROC, and Precision. Address overfitting and underfitting to ensure reliable predictions.

Interpretation & Insights: Use techniques like SHAP to interpret the modelâ€™s decision-making and extract actionable insights on lifestyle changes for diabetes prevention.

Deployment: Implement the model in healthcare settings for predictive purposes and establish a feedback system for continuous improvement.
